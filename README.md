# Varethis

**Varethis** is a roguelike, turn-based RPG steeped in the mechanics and flavor of **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**. Explore procedurally generated dungeons, engage in tactical combat, build your character through meaningful choices, and uncover the secrets of a world torn by arcane war.

## 🎲 Features

* **Turn-Based Combat:** Strategic, grid-based encounters inspired by D\&D 5e's action economy (Actions, Bonus Actions, Reactions, etc.).
* **Procedural Dungeons:** Each playthrough is unique, with randomized dungeons, loot, and encounters.
* **Deep Character Customization:**

  * Choose from classic archetypes (Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, etc.)
  * Multiclassing, Feats, Backgrounds, and Subclasses
* **DnD-Inspired Systems:**

  * Ability Scores, Saving Throws, Skills
  * Advantage/Disadvantage mechanics
  * Spellcasting with spell slots, prepared spells, and concentration
* **Permadeath & Replayability:** Death is permanent—each run challenges you to adapt and survive with new characters.
* **Narrative Lore:** Discover the lost history of Varethis through cryptic journals, encounters, and environmental storytelling.

## ⚔️ Gameplay Overview

* **Turn Order:** Initiative rolls determine turn order. On each turn, characters can move, attack, cast spells, use abilities, or interact with the environment.
* **Exploration:** Uncover hidden passages, solve environmental puzzles, and manage limited resources like torches, rations, and spell slots.
* **Resting:** Short rests and long rests function similarly to D\&D 5e. Choose wisely when to rest in the unforgiving depths.

## 📜 Character Creation

1. **Race:** Choose from a variety of fantasy races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Tiefling, etc.)
2. **Class:** Select a class and gain access to a unique spell list and combat abilities.
3. **Background:** Grants proficiencies, roleplay flavor, and sometimes hidden perks.
4. **Stats:** Roll or point-buy your Ability Scores (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA).
